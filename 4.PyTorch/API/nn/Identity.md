# Identity


nn.Identity is a PyTorch module that represents an identity function. It simply returns its input tensor as its output tensor, without applying any transformation.

The nn.Identity module is useful in cases where you want to create a neural network architecture that passes its input through a sequence of layers, but you want to skip certain layers and pass the input directly to the output. In this case, you can use nn.Identity as a placeholder module for the skipped layers.

>Example
```py
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.identity = nn.Identity()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.pool(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.identity(x)  # skip conv3
        x = self.pool(x)
        x = self.conv3(x)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.pool(x)
        return x
```

In this example, we define a PyTorch model MyModel that consists of three convolutional layers and a max pooling layer. We use nn.Identity as a placeholder module to skip the third convolutional layer. The forward() method of the model applies the convolutional and pooling layers in sequence, and uses the nn.Identity module to skip the third convolutional layer.

Note that in this example, we use the torch.relu() function to apply the ReLU activation function to the output of the convolutional layers. Alternatively, we could use the nn.ReLU module to achieve the same result.
