# F.pad


F.pad is a function in the PyTorch library that is used to pad a given tensor with zeros or with a constant value. The function takes as input a tensor, a list of padding values for each dimension of the tensor, and the padding mode (constant or reflect). The output of the function is a new tensor with the same number of dimensions as the input tensor but with the specified padding.

```py
import torch.nn.functional as F
import torch

x = torch.randn(3, 4)
padded_x = F.pad(x, (1, 1, 2, 2), mode='constant', value=0)
